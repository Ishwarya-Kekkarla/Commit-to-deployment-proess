Committing Changes: After developing the new feature in a feature branch, the developer commits the changes to the version control system (VCS) repository. This typically involves adding changed files, writing a commit message explaining the changes, and then committing those changes to the repository.

Code Review (Optional): Depending on the team's workflow, the committed code may undergo a code review process. In this step, one or more team members review the code changes to ensure they meet coding standards, follow best practices, and fulfill the requirements of the new feature. Any necessary feedback or changes are communicated back to the developer.

Continuous Integration (CI): The committed code triggers a CI pipeline. CI systems like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions automatically build the code, run automated tests, and perform other checks (such as code style formatting, linting, security scans, etc.). If any issues are detected, the developer is notified to address them.

Merge to Main Branch: Once the code has passed all checks, it's typically merged into the main development branch (e.g., master or main). This integration ensures that the new feature works well with the rest of the codebase.

Release Planning: Depending on the team's release schedule, the new feature may be included in the next planned release. Release planning involves coordinating with stakeholders to determine the scope of the release, scheduling it, and preparing any necessary documentation or release notes.

Deployment to Staging Environment: Before deploying to production, the code is deployed to a staging or pre-production environment. This environment closely resembles the production environment but is isolated from real users. It allows for final testing and validation of the new feature in a controlled setting.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT): In some cases, stakeholders or end-users may perform UAT in the staging environment to ensure the new feature meets their requirements and expectations.

Final Approval: Once the new feature has been thoroughly tested and approved in the staging environment, it's ready for deployment to production.

Deployment to Production: The finalized code is deployed to the production environment. This may involve using deployment tools like Ansible, Docker, or Kubernetes to automate the process and ensure consistency.

Monitoring and Post-Deployment Checks: After deployment, the operations team monitors the production environment to ensure everything is running smoothly. This may involve monitoring performance metrics, error logs, and user feedback.

Rollback Plan (Optional): In case of any issues or unexpected behavior in production, there should be a rollback plan in place to quickly revert to the previous stable version.

Post-Deployment Tasks: After the new feature is deployed to production, any necessary follow-up tasks such as updating documentation, notifying users about the new feature, or conducting training may be performed.
